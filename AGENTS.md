# Project: Recipe Book

## Project Description
A local-first single-page web app for creating and managing recipes, with optional cloud sync. Built on Yjs for real-time collaborative state, with an e-ink inspired aesthetic (2D wireframe, handwritten style) and touch/click-first interactions.

## Code Conventions
- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint for linting
- Functional components with hooks for React
- 2-space indentation
- TitleCase for components, classes, and enum type names
- camelCase for function names (including hooks, event handlers, and utility functions)
- snake_case for data: object/interface field names, Yjs map keys, and CSS class names

## Common Development Tasks

```
npm run typecheck     # Typecheck all files
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run lint          # Run the linter on all files
```

The app is running at http://localhost:5173, and you can use the Playwright MCP to access it.

## Rules

- ALWAYS use relative paths over absolute paths to avoid needing to prompt me for access.
- MUST ALWAYS run `npm run typecheck`, then `npm test`, and then `npm run lint` for all files before commiting code changes.
- MUST ALWAYS commit all completed work with a comprehensive git commit message using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) where applicable.
- MUST ALWAYS keep CLAUDE.md up-to-date with file structure, architecture, testing, and data models.
- MUST ALWAYS keep PROJECT_SUMMARY.md up-to-date with any changes to completed features and future development goals.
- MUST ALWAYS write unit tests for all changes.
- MUST NEVER skip unit tests using early returns. Instead, ALWAYS provide a test fixture with values that meet the test pre-conditions when initializing the game state or throw something on unexpected state to satisfy the type checker.
- MUST ALWAYS write component tests for all view changes.
- MUST NEVER use the `as` keyword to cast a type without validating every field in the type.
- MUST NEVER use the `in` keyword to test for the existance of a property on a union type. Instead, use the proper type union discriminator field to narrow the type to the desired type or interface.
- MUST NEVER use the `any` type. Instead, try your best to define a strict generic type. If you are adding type information to something that does not allow passing the type information along (such as deserialization or APIs that return untyped data), then use a specific function to validate and cast the object as the expected / provided type. Or, as a last resort, use the `unknown` type instead.
- MUST ALWAYS use double quotes ("") for constant strings, unless the string itself contains double quotes, in which case, you should use single quotes ('"'), unless the string contains both double and single quotes, in which case use backticks (`"''"`).
- MUST ALWAYS use responsive design to ensure that the elements never require horizontal scrolling, while maximizing use of horizontal space for mobile device, tablet, laptop, and wide screens.
- MUST ALWAYS use CSS over JavaScript for styling elements.
- MUST ALWAYS use `vw` units unless the element is a horizontal line or when creating a font-size that is relative to a sibling or parent element, in which case, `em` is fine.
- MUST ALWAYS use camelCase for React component props, local variables, and constant references. Keep snake_case for all fields stored in Yjs documents, and any string values such as discriminator fields (e.g. `"measurement_type"`).

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure (3 npm sub-projects)

```
recipe-book/
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/        # Yjs models, types, operations — shared by web & server
│   ├── web/           # Vite + React SPA (y-indexeddb for local persistence)
│   │   └── public/
│   │       └── kitchenware.csv   # Static asset: default kitchenware (served by Vite)
│   └── server/        # Node.js sync server (Yjs document store per user)
├── CLAUDE.md
└── PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
```

### State & Sync

- **Local persistence:** `y-indexeddb` (browser IndexedDB)
- **Cross-browser sync:** Optional Node.js server; URL configurable via Vite env var (`VITE_SYNC_SERVER_URL`) stored in localStorage
- **Server:** Single `/sync` endpoint exchanges Yjs updates for a user's document and sends back updates to the default kitchenware list
- **Conflict resolution:** On kitchenware conflicts, user is prompted to accept incoming, keep local, or rename local and accept incoming

## Data Models (Yjs)

### Kitchenware

Kitchenware (ingredients, containers, equipment) lives in a global shared list with defaults shipped as a CSV static asset (`packages/web/public/kitchenware.csv`). On page load, if IndexedDB is empty, `use_ingredient_store` fetches `/kitchenware.csv`, parses it via `parse_kitchenware_csv`, and calls `init_from_kitchenware_templates` to populate the Yjs doc.

**CSV columns:** `Unique ID` (left-padded to 12 chars with `"-"`), `Type`, `Description`, `Default Measurement Type`, `Labels` ("+"-separated)

#### ItemLabel
- `id`: `ItemLabelId` (branded nanoid, 7 chars)
- `name`: string
- `kinds`: `ReadonlySet<ItemKind>` — which item types this label applies to

Labels are stored in the `"labels"` Yjs map on the document root. Deleting a label cascades to remove it from all ingredient label sets (via Yjs observer in `use_label_store`). Merging replaces multiple old IDs with a single new ID transactionally.

#### Ingredient
- `id`: `IngredientId` (branded nanoid, 12 chars)
- `name`: string
- `default_measurement_value`: `Measurement` — a full value like `{ value: {1,1}, unit: "cup" }` (migrated from old `default_measurement_type`)
- `labels`: `ReadonlySet<ItemLabelId>` (stored as `string[]` in Yjs, reconstructed as Set on read)
- `parent_id?`: `IngredientId` (supports subtypes; e.g. "Shredded Cheddar" → "Shredded Cheese" → "Cheese")

#### Container
- `id`: `ContainerId` (branded nanoid, 12 chars)
- `name`: string (bowl, steamer, pot, aluminium foil, etc.)
- `labels`: `ReadonlySet<ItemLabelId>`
- `parent_id?`: `ContainerId` (supports container hierarchies)

#### Equipment
- `id`: `EquipmentId` (branded nanoid, 12 chars)
- `name`: string (oven, stove, etc.)
- `labels`: `ReadonlySet<ItemLabelId>`

**Branded IDs** use `ts-brand` phantom types (`Brand<string, "IngredientId">`) for compile-time type safety. Namespace+interface merging enables the `IngredientId` dot notation. Named IDs are left-padded to 12 chars with `"-"` (ASCII 45, below all nanoid chars) so they sort before random IDs.

### Recipe

- `id`: `RecipeId` (branded nanoid, 12 chars)
- `title`: string
- `subtitle?`: string
- `source_url?`: string (URL format)
- `parent_folder_id?`: `RecipeFolderId`
- `versions`: `RecipeVersion[]` (append-only)
- `created_at`: timestamp
- `updated_at`: timestamp

#### RecipeVersion
A snapshot of a recipe's ingredients and sections at a point in time.

- `id`: `RecipeVersionId` (branded nanoid, 12 chars)
- `recipe_id`: `RecipeId`
- `description`: string (e.g. "Untested" or "Final Version")
- `ingredients`: `RecipeIngredient[]` — top-level ingredient list (ingredient_id + optional Measurement)
- `sections`: `Section[]` — ordered list of sections containing `SectionItem`s
- `created_at`: timestamp
- `created_by`: string

#### SectionItem (recursive)

Sections contain `SectionItem[]`. Each item is one of:
  - `IngredientItem` — ingredient ref, optional `amount` (Measurement), notes
  - `ContainerItem` — container ref, `descriptor`, optional `ordered`, nested `IngredientItem[]`, notes
  - `TextBlock` — freeform text, notes
  - `Instruction` — instruction verb (mix/bake/stir), optional `equipment_id`, optional `ingredient_ids[]`, optional `duration_seconds`, notes
  - `Section` — nested section with optional `header` and recursive `contents`

### Measurement

Always displayed as simplified integer + fraction. All operations preserve exact rational arithmetic.

```
{ value: Fraction, unit: MeasurementUnit }
```

`MeasurementUnit` belongs to a `MeasurementType` (`volume` | `weight`). Units can be converted within the same type.

### Session

An "active session" is a started recipe run:

- `id`: string
- `recipe_version_id`: string
- `started_at`: timestamp
- `completed_at?`: timestamp
- `item_states`: map of item id → `{ checked: boolean, one_off_quantity?: Measurement, notes?: string }`
- `rescale_multiplier?: Fraction`
- `rating?: number` (0–10, shown as 0–5 stars)
- `session_notes?: string`

### Recipe Folder (formerly RecipeGroup)

Recursive tree structure for organizing recipes. Stored flat in `"recipe_folders"` Yjs map; tree built in-memory via `parent_folder_id` links.

- `id`: `RecipeFolderId` (branded nanoid, 12 chars)
- `name`: string
- `parent_folder_id?`: `RecipeFolderId` (supports arbitrary nesting)
- `tags`: string[]
- `sort_order`: `"last_modified" | "created" | "alphabetical" | "manual"`
- `manual_order?`: string[] (recipe/folder ids)
- `children?`: `RecipeFolder[]` (computed, not stored)

> Backward-compat aliases: `RecipeGroupId = RecipeFolderId`, `RecipeGroup = RecipeFolder`.

## UI Pages & Components

### Home Page
- Active sessions list: progress bar, estimated time left, percent complete (opens in new tab)
- Search bar: searches recipes, kitchenware, and groups

### Recipe Editor
- Edit name and description
- Add sections with an optional header
- Add/edit ingredients (with measurement editor)
- Add/edit containers (bowl, steamer, pot, foil) containing nested ingredients
- Add/edit equipment instructions (bake 20 min, sear on high, mix 20 min, etc.)
- Add/edit text blocks
- Add/edit sub-sections
- Attach notes to any sections or section items
- Auto-grouping ingredients (ex: group by label - solid or liquid)
- Save as a new version
- View past versions (version history)
- Clone and rename recipe
- View session log
- Move to a parent group ("organize")

### Active Session View
- Ingredients and containers as checkboxes (nested for containers)
- Checking a container does not auto-check its contents
- "±" button per ingredient opens the measurement value editor:
  - After any button press, replaced by a visual slider with "-"/"+" buttons
  - "OK" to accept, "Rescale" to open bulk rescale interface with current one-off adjustments
- Attach notes to ingredients, containers, or sections
- Marks session complete

### Bulk Rescale Interface
- "Rescale multiplier" input (uses measurement editor component)
- "Include one-off adjustments" checkbox (unchecked by default; when checked, resets one-offs to `original × multiplier`)
- Can open with pre-filled one-off adjustments
- "Rescale to adjusted amount" button per ingredient (sets multiplier to ratio of one-off ÷ original)
- Additional one-off adjustment inputs (reuses active session one-off component)
- "Cancel" / "Accept" buttons

### Edit Past Session
- 5-star (0–10) rating
- Attach notes
- Update existing recipe with a new version using session measurements
- Clone and name a new recipe from the session

### Measurement Value Editor (shared component)
1. Display: `${integer}<sup>${num}</sup>⁄<sub>${denom}</sub>`
2. Radio buttons: ➗ / × / − / + (opens one of 4 button rows):
   - ➗2, ➗3, ➗5
   - ×2, ×3, ×5
   - −1, −½, −⅓, −⅕, −⅛
   - +⅛, +⅕, +⅓, +½, +1
3. "OK" — accepts value; if a measurement unit, converts to largest evenly-dividing unit
4. "<" — resets to value before editor opened
- Unit selector: radio/select for all units of the same measurement type

### Bulk Ingredient Editor
- Search/filter by label, default measurement type, or parent type
- Multi-select checkboxes
- Bulk actions: add label, remove label, change measurement type, change parent ingredient
- "Add new ingredient" form
- "Refresh filter" link when changes invalidate the current filter

### Recipe Group Editor (Directory View)
- Breadcrumb navigation back to root
- Recursive filter by name (shows full parent-chain to matches)
- Add tags to current group or to recipes/subgroups
- Sort by last modified, date created, or alphabetical
- Manual drag-and-drop reorder
- Per-item buttons: edit recipe, expand versions, expand subgroup

### Recipe Import
- URL input → scrape page content (strip ads, extract text + links)
- Local AI processes scraped content into ingredients, containers, instructions, text blocks
- Review and confirm before saving

### Top Nav Bar
- "☰" hamburger menu to navigate between pages
- "↩ Undo" button (Yjs undo manager)

## Design System

- **Aesthetic:** 2D wireframe / handwritten style, e-ink white background
- **Interactions:** Touch/click first
- **Layout:** Responsive — no horizontal scrolling; maximize horizontal space at all screen sizes
- **Styling:** CSS-only (no JS layout), `vw` units for widths (except relative font sizes use `em`)
- **Fractions:** Always simplified; displayed as integer + proper fraction superscript/subscript

## Testing Architecture

- **Unit tests:** Vitest — all models, operations, and utility functions
- **Component tests:** Vitest + React Testing Library — all view components
- **Typecheck:** `tsc --noEmit`
- **Lint:** ESLint + Prettier
